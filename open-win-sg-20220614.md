## 1. Updates to the SG

- Tom steps in as Academic Lead. Thank you Clare for you leadership on this project so far! 
- Welcome the Open WIN Ambassadors to the SG:
    - Dejan Draschkow (already on the SG re: Tasks Working Group)
    - Yingshi Feng
    - Verena Sarrazin
    - Bernd Taschler
    - We look forward to incorporating their perspective and extending our researcher representation, particularly to include DPhil students.


## 2. Proposal to focus on Open Data for the next period

- In the next period we will look to unite the energies and resources of the many individuals who contribute to the Open WIN project by focusing on ‘One Big Issue’ at a time. 
- This model has been successful in both our Public Engagement (PE) and Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity (EDI) projects, which are looking to address similar complex issues which require significant behaviour change.
- The role of the Steering Group will be to ensure the diversity of our technical expertise and requirements is appropriately catered for in the Open Data Portal. 
- The SG may also be called on to support user testing and contribute to the progression of other activities, eg requirements development.

## 3. Decision framework for data sharing

- Data sharing decision tree has evolved into a set of questions which researchers are invited to consider regarding the practicalities of sharing data: The “[Data Sharing Decision Framework](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/data/can-i/)”.
- SG is asked to note that this information is under development and is guiding the delivery of our infrastructure.
- We welcome the opportunity to work closely with your research teams when they are considering or approached for data sharing, and monitor their progress or challenges in using this framework.
